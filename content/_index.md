## Welcome to Pine-Richland Ultimate

Pine-Richland Ultimate is a co-ed high school ultimate frisbee program that has grown from a small club into a respected presence in the Pittsburgh High School Ultimate League (PHUL).

## Team history  

The Pine-Richland ultimate team began as a student-driven club in the mid-2000s with roughly a dozen players and quickly committed to competing in the local PHUL structure.  Over time, the program expanded its roster, joined USA Ultimate’s high school division, and earned regional recognition by winning multiple league titles, including back-to-back PHUL championships for the boys team.

The team reflects the broader Pine-Richland athletic mission, emphasizing academic excellence, personal growth, and sportsmanship alongside competitive success.  PR Ultimate leans into ultimate’s “Spirit of the Game,” teaching athletes to self-officiate, resolve conflicts respectfully, and compete with integrity while still pushing themselves to play at a high level.

## What makes PR Ultimate special
